# Theme reference screenshots

Add two screenshots here to compare light vs dark mode:

- **light-mode.png** – App with theme set to light (sun icon visible). Header and sidebars should be light with dark text.
- **dark-mode.png** – App with theme set to dark (moon icon visible). Header and sidebars should be dark with light text.

The board (white canvas) should look the same in both. See [THEME-VISUAL-GUIDE.md](../THEME-VISUAL-GUIDE.md) for the full checklist.
