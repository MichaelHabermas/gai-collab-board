# Usage Tracker

Use the **usage-tracker** skill whenever the user asks to:

- Add usage tracking, track tokens, track spending
- Add the usage hook, set up cost tracking
- Or any variation of per-project Claude/Cursor usage monitoring

Also use it when setting up a new project if the user has indicated they want usage tracking on all projects.

## What the skill does

The skill installs a stop hook that logs every session's token usage and estimated cost. It copies a script and config so that:

1. **Claude Code**: `.claude/hooks/track-usage.mjs` + `.claude/settings.local.json` (Stop hook)
2. **Cursor**: same script is invoked from `.cursor/hooks.json` (stop hook)

Both write to the same outputs (no double counting — sessions are deduplicated by session/conversation ID):

- `USAGE.md` at project root — human-readable report
- `.claude/usage/usage-data.json` — legacy per-session JSON
- `.claude/usage/unified-usage-data.json` — when the project has the unified pipeline (e.g. `scripts/record-usage-event.ts`), the hook updates this ledger

Follow the install procedure in `.claude/skills/usage-tracker/usage-tracker/SKILL.md`: create `.claude/hooks`, copy `assets/track-usage.mjs` into `.claude/hooks/track-usage.mjs`, configure `.claude/settings.local.json` for Claude and `.cursor/hooks.json` for Cursor if not already present. Suggest adding `.claude/usage/` to `.gitignore` (or specific files there) as needed.
