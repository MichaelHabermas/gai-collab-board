# Bun and Vite

## Bun

- **Use Bun as the runtime and package manager.** Run scripts with `bun run <script>` (or `bun <file>` for direct execution).
- Do not use `npm run`, `pnpm`, or `node`, `yarn`, or `npx` for running project scripts or tooling.

## Vite

- **Use Vite for the dev server and production build.** Do not introduce or recommend other bundlers (e.g. webpack, Parcel) for this project.
- Keep using the existing Vite config and scripts in `package.json`.

## New scripts

- Prefer adding new scripts that use `bun run` and Vite as in existing scripts; `package.json` scripts are the source of truth.
