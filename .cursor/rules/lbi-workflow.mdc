# LBI Workflow

## Initial Check

1. **Check if `.lbi` exists** in the project root (e.g. `.lbi/manifest.json`, `.lbi/memory/`, `.lbi/config/`).
2. **If `.lbi` exists**, treat the project as LBI-enabled and use `/lbi` slash commands when they fit the task.
3. **Command reference**: Use `.cursor/commands/lbi.lbi.md` for the full list of commands and descriptions; `.cursor/commands/lbi.help.md` for workflow and help.

## Use LBI As You Go

- **Re-check applicability at each phase.** As the task moves from request → spec → plan → implement → tests → review → push, consider whether the current phase maps to an LBI command and use it when useful.
- Do not only consider LBI at the start; at each logical step (e.g. "now we need a plan", "now we implement", "now we add tests"), decide if an LBI command applies and invoke it when it does.
- For small, well-understood changes use the lite workflow: `/lbi.lite.request` → `/lbi.lite.plan` → `/lbi.lite.implement` → `/lbi.lite.push`.
- Skip `/lbi` only when the task is clearly unrelated (e.g. one-off config, or user says not to use LBI).

## Note Each Command for User Verification

- **Whenever an LBI command is used**, state it clearly in the flow so the user can verify:
  - At the start of the step, call out the command (e.g. "**Using `/lbi.plan`** for this step" or "LBI: `/lbi.specify`").
  - Or briefly at the end of the step (e.g. "Step completed via **`/lbi.implement`**.").
- Keep the note short and visible (e.g. one line or a small block) so the user can confirm which command was applied at each stage.

## Summary

- **If `.lbi` exists** → Use `/lbi` commands as the flow progresses; refer to `.cursor/commands/lbi.lbi.md` for the list. **Note each command used in the flow for user verification.**
