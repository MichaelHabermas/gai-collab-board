# Git Merge Workflow

- **NEVER merge to `main`.** Do not merge feature or fix branches into `main`, and do not push merge commits to `origin/main`.
- **Merge only to `development`.** Feature and fix branches must be merged into `development` (e.g. `git checkout development && git merge <branch>` then `git push origin development`).
- When asked to "merge" or "push and merge", merge the current branch into **development** and push `development`; do not touch `main`.
